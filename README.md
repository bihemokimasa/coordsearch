# coordsearch
C++ source for Generalized Pattern Search Algorithms for gradient-free optimization for cluster parallel computation

The class ClusterCoordSearch is particularly useful. It's designed to run on a cluster by a number of parallel teams, where each team in turn runs a number of processes in parallel.
